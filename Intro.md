Course Syllabus for "CHEM108: Analytical Chemistry"
---------------------------------------------------

Analytical chemistry is the branch of chemistry dealing with
measurement, both qualitative and quantitative.  This discipline is also
concerned with the chemical composition of samples.  In the field,
analytical chemistry is applied when detecting the presence and
determining the quantities of chemical compounds, such as lead in water
samples or arsenic in tissue samples.  It also encompasses many
different spectrochemical techniques, all of which are used under
various experimental conditions.  This branch of chemistry teaches the
general theories behind the use of each instrument as well analysis of
experimental data. This course begins with a review of general chemistry
and an introduction to analytical terminology.  You will learn terms
relevant to the process of measuring chemical compounds, such as
sensitivity and detection limit.  The course continues with a unit on
common spectrochemical methods, followed by an extension of these
methods in a unit on atomic spectroscopy.  These methods allow the
qualitative and quantitative analysis of compounds of interest.  You
will also learn about chromatography, which is the science behind
purifying samples.  Separations of complex mixtures are achieved through
a variety of chromatographic techniques.  The course concludes with a
section on electrochemical methods, examining the interaction between
the electrolyte and current of potential during chemical reactions. 
Please keep in mind that many chemistry courses, especially analytical
chemistry, require laboratory experiments to reinforce these concepts;
however, this course provides supplemental material in order to convey
this information.  After successful completion of this course, you will
understand the techniques used in qualitative and quantitative analysis
of chemical compounds.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Demonstrate a mastery of various methods of expressing
    concentration.
-   Use a linear calibration curve to calculate concentration.
-   Describe the various spectrochemical techniques as described within
    the course.
-   Use sample data obtained from spectrochemical techniques to
    calculate unknown concentrations or obtain structural information
    where applicable.
-   Describe the various chromatographies described within this course
    and analyze a given chromatogram.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of electrochemistry and the methods
    used to study the response of an electrolyte through current of
    potential.
